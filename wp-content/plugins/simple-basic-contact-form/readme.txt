== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is the plugin setting for the "From" email header?**

That setting enables you to customize the address used as the "From" header for email messages. If your email address is a domain-based address, then this setting should be the same as the previous Email setting. Otherwise, if you are using a 3rd-party email service, this setting should be a local, domain-based address. If you find that email messages are getting sent to the spam bin, this setting may help.
